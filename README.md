Flappy Doge 2048 (Nyan Cat edition)
===================================

Because crazy can be fun.

[Play here](http://rawgithub.com/boppreh/flappy_doge_2048/master/flappy_doge_2048.html) (temporary link).

`W` + `S` control **Doge**, while arrow keys control **2048** blocks.

Move and merge the blocks to give space for the doge to go through. Catch the **Nyan** cats to slow down.
